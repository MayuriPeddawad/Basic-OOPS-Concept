OOPS Concept :

1.Class
2.Object
3.Data Abstraction
4.Encapsulation
5.Inheritance
6.Polymorphism
7.Dynamic Binding
8.Message Passing

1) Class : 
-->A class is user defined data type .
-->It consist of data member and member function.which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of class.
-->Class is blueprint of object

2) Object :
-->It is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represent a real life entities.
--> An obejct is instance of class 
--> when class is defined , no memory is allocated but ehrn it is  instantiated(object is created) memory is allocated.
--> object ahas and identity,state and behivour.

3) Data Abstration :
--> It is one of the most essential and important feature of OOP.
--> It is refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding background details or implementation.

4) Encapsulation :
--> It is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
--> It is mechanism that binds together code and data it manipulates.
--> The variables or data of a class are hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of their class in which they are declared.
--> The data in a class is hidden from other classes, so it is also known as data-hiding.

5) Inheritance :
--> The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. 
--> When we write a class, we inherit properties from other classes.
--> Inheritance allows the user to reuse the code whenever possible and reduce its redundancy.

                                                            |                                                          \\  //
                                                      Derived Class 2                                              Derived Class D

6) Polymorphism :
--> The word polymorphism means having many forms.
--> polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. 

                                              _funtion overloading
--> Types of Polymorphism :|-- Compile Time -|_operator overloading          
                           |
                           |-- Run Time -- virtal function

7) Dynamic Binding :
--> The code to be executed in response to the function call is decided at runtime.
--> Dynamic binding means that the code associated with a given procedure call is not known until the time of the call at run time.

8) Message Passing :
--> It is a form of communication used in object-oriented programming as well as parallel programming.
--> Objects communicate with one another by sending and receiving information to each other.
